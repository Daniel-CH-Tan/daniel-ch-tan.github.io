**About me**: I am a first-year M.Phil / PhD candidate at University College London. I am part of the Advanced Intelligent Robotics Lab, co-supervised by Zhibin (Alex) Li and Dimitrios Kanoulas. 

**My interests**: My PhD research direction aims to develop approaches for lifelong learning to enable long-lived deployment of autonomous intelligent systems deployed in the real world. Currently, I am interested in world models, representation learning, and learning of reusable, general-purpose skills in multi-task environments. 

**Previously**: I was a research Engineer at A*STAR, Institute of Infocomm Research, Robotics and Autonomous Systems Department. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Stanford University.
